For the final project, I conducted an extensive analysis of a credit card company's customer database, comprising nearly fifty thousand entries. This analysis involved establishing crucial indicators such as RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary), CAI (Customer Activity Index), and CRI (Customer Reliability Index) to track customer behavior. Furthermore, I applied K-means clustering to classify customers into three distinct segments and performed a comprehensive basket analysis. The project concluded with a detailed analysis report containing strategic recommendations aimed at promoting credit card usage among customers.
